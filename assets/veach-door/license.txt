This scene is remodeled after Eric Veach and Leo Guibas (Metropolis Light
Transport, http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/258734.258775). We modeled the scene for
our own work on Gradient-Domain Metropolis Light Transport
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2461912.2461943).

The scene is particularly difficult for light transport algorithms, since
all visible illumination is indirect, and comes to the room from a bright
source in an adjacent room through a narrowly open door.
